2. Subway
We would like to create a management system for the orders in a restaurant.
Our restaurant only sells two kinds of items, Sandwiches and Drinks.
Maintain a list of the ordered items and their prices.
A drink has a fixed price based on its flavor.
A sandwich's price is the sum of its ingredients' prices.
